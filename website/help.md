# Getting Help with OpenEXR

See the [download](download.md) page for help build and installing
OpenEXR from source.

There are two primary ways to connect with the OpenEXR project:

* The openexr-dev@lists.aswf.io mail list: This is a development
  focused mail list with a deep history of technical conversations and
  decisions that have shaped the project. Subscribe at
  [openexr-dev@lists.aswf.io](https://lists.aswf.io/g/openexr-dev).

* GitHub Issues: GitHub issues are used both to track bugs and to
  discuss feature requests.

## How to Ask for Help

If you have trouble installing, building, or using the library, but
there's not yet reason to suspect you've encountered a genuine bug,
start by posting a question to the
[openexr-dev](http://lists.aswf.io/openexr-dev) mailing list. This is
the place for question such has "How do I...".

## How to Report a Bug

OpenEXR use GitHub's issue tracking system for bugs and enhancements:
https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/issues

If you are submitting a bug report, please be sure to note which
version of OpenEXR you are using, on what platform (OS/version, which
compiler you used, and any special build flags or other unusual
environmental issues). Please give a specific account of

* what you tried
* what happened
* what you expected to happen instead

with enough detail that others can reproduce the problem.

## How to Request a Change

Open a GitHub issue: https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/issues.

Describe the situation and the objective in as much detail as
possible. Feature requests will almost certainly spawn a discussion
among the project community.

## How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you think you've found a potential vulnerability in OpenEXR, please
refer to [SECURITY.md] to responsibly disclose it.

## How to Contribute a Bug Fix or Change
